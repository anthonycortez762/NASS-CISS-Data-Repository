side of the road onto a cement sidewalk and impacted a brick wall with its,79,14,F,10," 14F",8
front and came to rest. Vehicles 1 & 2 were towed due to damage and v-3 was,79,14,F,11," 14F",8
driven from the scene. The driver of V-1 was transported and released from a,79,14,F,12," 14F",8

"in the #2 lane going straight. As the vehicles approached each other, the",79,17,K,5," 17K",8
front of V-1 impacted with the front of V-2 at an obtuse angle. The force of,79,17,K,6," 17K",8
this impact rotated V-1 to head south and the right side of V-1 impacted with,79,17,K,7," 17K",8
the left side of V-2 in a sideslap. Both vehicles continued to head south,79,17,K,8," 17K",8

departed the roadway to its right onto an asphalt shoulder. V-1 then,79,19,J,4," 19J",8
travelled back onto the travel lanes heading in a east north east direction,79,19,J,5," 19J",8
and began to roll to its left. The vehicle rolled 8 quarter turns across the,79,19,J,6," 19J",8
center dirt median and guard rail and onto the #3 westbound travel lane where,79,19,J,7," 19J",8

a like crossing street. V-2 was westbound in the #2 lane going straight on,79,24,K,3," 24K",8
the like crossing street. As both vehicles travelled through the,79,24,K,4," 24K",8
"intersection, the front of V-1 impacted with the right side of V-2. This",79,24,K,5," 24K",8
caused V-2 to travel southwest and its front impacted with a signal control,79,24,K,6," 24K",8
box that was mounted on a 11cm diameter pole. After the second impact V-2,79,24,K,7," 24K",8
"came to rest in the roadway facing south. Meanwhile, V-1 had headed south and",79,24,K,8," 24K",8
